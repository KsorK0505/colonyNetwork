# Contributing

Help is always appreciated!

The focus currently is implementing the [Colony White Paper](https://colony.io/whitepaper.pdf) which was split down in distinct chunks into the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork/issues). 

Specifically we need help with the [Colony Network Token Sale MVP Backlog](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Colony+Network+Token+Sale+MVP%22+is%3Aopen). Items already being worked on are labelled "in-progress" to avoid work duplication.

When making a larger change, please consult with the team on [Colony Network Gitter channel](http://gitter.im/JoinColony/colonyNetwork).

## How to report issues

To report an issue, use the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork/issues).

## Workflow for Pull Requests

In order to contribute, please fork off of the develop branch and make your changes there. Keep your branch up to date with develop using `git rebase`. Your PR description should provide a clear overview of your changes.

When writing a new feature, please ensure you write appropriate `truffle` test cases under test/. We strive for 100% test coverage for our contracts and CI works with close to 100% thresholds.

Thank you for your help!
