# Streaming Payments / Salaries (`StreamingPayments`)

This expenditure enables ongoing "streaming" payments, useful for implementing
salaries. Users with the Administration and Funding permissions can create
streaming payments, indicating the tokens and amounts to be transferred
over a given interval of time. Users can then claim tokens continually, at
whatever frequency they choose.
