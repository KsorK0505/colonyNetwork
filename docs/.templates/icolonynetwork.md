# Colony Network (`IColonyNetwork`)

The functions for managing the Colony Network as a whole. Includes functions
for creating and upgrading colonies, managing the reputation mining process,
managing the skills used in colonies, and managing colony ENS names.
These functions are not publically callable, but rather callable by
the Meta Colony, a special colony which controls the network.
